# rabc

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rabc is to facilitate the development of animal behaviour classification models using accelerometer data.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YuHuiDeakin/rabc", build_vignette = TRUE)
# It will take several minutes to install the package because of vignette building. 
```
## Workflow of the package

Here is the function workflow of the package:

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rabc)
## basic example code

## order data by behaviour labels 
whitestork_acc_sorted <- order_acc(whitestork_acc)

## calculate ACC data into time domain features
df_time <- calculate_feature_time(whitestork_acc_sorted, winlen_dba = 11)

## use time domain features to train a model and output results
predictions <- plot_confusion_matrix(df_time, vec_label = whitestork_acc_sorted$V121)
```
